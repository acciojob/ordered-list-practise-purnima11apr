# Write a HTML program to create an ordered list explaining the code optimisation, use content from below text:

We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program,

1) We can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied
2) We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase itâ€™s total run time
3) We can reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms
